![Portfolio Preview](assets/images/isagi_motivational_focus_v4.jpg)

## 📌 Overview
This is a **personal portfolio website** designed with a unique narrative approach inspired by the philosophy of **Isagi Yoichi** from the anime *Blue Lock*. It is not just a showcase of technical skills but a storytelling experience that connects my background in competitive esports with my journey into software engineering and leadership.

The project demonstrates the ability to build a **performant, responsive, and multi-lingual** web application using core web technologies without reliance on heavy frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Language Support (i18n)**: Fully implemented custom internationalization system supporting **English (EN), Russian (RU), Ukrainian (UA), and Slovak (SK)**.
- **Narrative-Driven Design**: A layout that guides the visitor through a "Story" section, utilizing scroll interactions and visual storytelling.
- **Responsive & Adaptive**: Optimized for all devices, from mobile phones to high-resolution desktops.
- **Performance Focused**: Built with pure Vanilla JS and CSS for maximum speed and minimal bloat.
- **Custom Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects to enhance user engagement.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**: Advanced styling using Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Variables for theming.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**:
  - Custom DOM manipulation.
  - `translations.js` for handling dynamic language switching.
  - Event handling for navigation and mobile menus.
